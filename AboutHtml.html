                What these new features that we will provide to you ?😍😉<br /> <br />
                <b>First :</b>If you took a book and finished reading it and did not want it with you, at this time you can return it to us and we will give you half of the price that you paid when buying it😉
                but if you are the second buyer of this book, you will take it at a price less than its price ... and so on.💁‍♀️<br /> <br />
                <b>Second :</b> All books will have an audio recording that reads the books, and this will be very useful for children and the blind due to their difficulty in reading.👌
                <b>Third :</b> We created the Readers Club application, which is an electronic search that will help you search for the books, novels and stories that you need <br /><br />
                if you remember one word from the name of a book consisting of three words, you will find many options until you find the book you want
                and you can also search for the names of the writers,then you can buy books from it.🤗<br /> <br />
                <b>Fourth :</b>:You may love reading very much, but you do not have enough knowledge about books, their names and types, so we will help you to reach your goal. You can talk on the page about the type of book you want to read and it will present to you.🤝❤️
